# Booker: Nashville's Interactive Venue Map

For any musician who has tried to book a tour through Nashville, the overwhelming number of options can be a deterrent in itself. My project aims to sort the noise into coherency, making it easier to browse and understand venues. 

Not all venues are alike in Nashville. Music City is, of course, home to multiple scenes that each live within a specific circuit of venues. Are you a singer/songwriter? Or a punk band? A studio musician looking to break into the work of Broadway Honkytonks? Or someone looking for a unique performance space? Anyone who has played a show knows the importance of set and setting: the wrong act at the wrong place is enough to tank a night for both the performer and audience members alike.
